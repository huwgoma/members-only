# Members Only!
This tutorial is part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum (which you can find [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only)).
The goal is to gain practice with authentication in Rails; this project will use the [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem to implement authentications.
